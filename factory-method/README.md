# 🏭 Factory Method

**Factory Method** is a creational design pattern that provides  
an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows  
subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

## 🧠 Intent

> Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.  
> Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
