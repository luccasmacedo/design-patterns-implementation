# 🔌 Adapter Pattern

**Adapter** is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together.  
It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces by wrapping one in a class that implements the other.

---

## 🧠 Intent

> Convert the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect.  
> Adapter lets classes work together that couldn’t otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

## 🔧 Also Known As

## 🛠️ Applicability

Use the Adapter pattern when:

- You want to use an existing class, but its interface does not match the one you need.
- You want to create a reusable class that cooperates with unrelated or unforeseen classes.
- You need to integrate a legacy or third-party system into your application without modifying its code.
